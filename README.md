# Venice-Boat-Classification
Image classifier for Venice boat recognition

Given the dataset provided by MarDCT (Maritime detection, classification
and tracking dataset) of the Venice boats images, build an image classifier
to classify the boats according to the type of boat. To solve the problem it
has been used a convolutional neural network approach with preprocessing
of the images.
After building multiple models with different parameters in the convolutional
neural network, the model has been tested on a validation dataset still pro-
vided by MarDCT.
